# Professional and Technical Communication Master's Degree Portfolio
## Projects
### Usability Study for an Animal Anatomy & Physiology eLearning application
> > For this usability study I created a Veterinary Anatomy and Physiology eLearning application targeted towards biological science undergraduates. As part of the project, I wrote supporting test documentation such as personas and scenarios, competitive analyses, storyboards, prototypes, and test protocols. I conducted usability interviews with the Paper Prototyping with Blank Pages technique with four undergraduate students at a local university. I statistically analyzed the test results and offered recommendations. <br><br>
> > I presented my study at a graduate student symposium at James Madison University, Harrisonburg, Virginia and at two New Jersey Institute of Technology graduate student events.<br><br>
> > This project was part of my Master's degree program in Professional and Technical Communication at New Jersey Institute of Technology. My effort on this project outperformed the course requirements and led to a Merit Award.<br><br>
